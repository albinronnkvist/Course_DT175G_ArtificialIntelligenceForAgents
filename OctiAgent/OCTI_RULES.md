### **Board & Components**  
- **Board**: 6×7 grid  
- **Pods**: 4 per player (own pods = “friendly”)  
- **Bases**: 4 per player  
- **Prongs**: 12 per player  

---

### **Game Monitor & Time Limits**  
- Moves are submitted through a server program (the **monitor**), which tracks the game.  
- Players have a limited time to decide their next move.  
- If a player submits a move early, unused time is discarded.  
- Exceeding the time limit is **not allowed**.

### **Player Actions (One Per Turn)**  
A player may **choose one** of the following actions:  

1. **Add a Prong** – Attach a prong to any friendly pod, allowing it to move in that direction.  
2. **Move a Pod** – Move a pod **one square** in a direction where it has a prong.  
3. **Jump (Optional Capture)**  
   - Jump over **any pod** (friendly or enemy) if a prong points in that direction.  
   - Multiple jumps are allowed in one turn.  
   - Jumps are **optional**—players don’t have to jump even if possible.  
   - The space behind each jumped pod **must be empty**.  
   - A pod **cannot jump twice over the same square in one turn**.

### **Capturing**  
- Jumped pods **may** be captured (all, some, or none).  
- Both **friendly and enemy pods** can be captured.  
- Capturing happens **at the end of the turn**.  
- Captured pods lose all their prongs, which the capturer can reuse in later turns.

1. **A pod lands on any opponent’s base.**  
2. **All of the opponent’s pods are captured.**
