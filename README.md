# DT175G - Artificial Intelligence for Agents

Artificial intelligence with a focus on intelligent problem-solving agents.

In this course, I explored artificial intelligence with an emphasis on intelligent problem-solving agents. The curriculum included search strategies, constraint satisfaction problems, adversarial search, and two-player zero-sum games. As part of the coursework, I developed an [Octi agent](https://github.com/albinronnkvist/Course_DT175G_ArtificialIntelligenceForAgents/tree/main/OctiAgent) in Java, incorporating Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a utility function for heuristic-based optimal moves, which participated in an Octi tournament.
